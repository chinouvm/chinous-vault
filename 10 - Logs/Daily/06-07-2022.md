# What did I do on the 6th of July
Today I created two beautiful cheatsheets for Git and Python. These cheatsheets will help me out a lot in the future because I can quickly search for the desired topics.

I also got a new idea for a template. A STARR reflection template. If I create a template for the STARR reflection I can quickly add a reflection to every school project I create with `ALT + E`
